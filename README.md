**Burningwave Tools** is a set of components based on Burningwave Core library that have high-level functionality
# Dependencies shrinking
By this functionality only the classes and resources strictly used by an application will be extracted and stored in a specified path. At the end of the execution of the task, a script will be created in the destination path to run the application using the extracted classes. **The dependency shrinkers can also be used to adapt applications written with Java old versions to Java 9 or later**.
